### 📖 Executive Summary
This project conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for maritime navigation safety. Using **2GB+ of AIS data** from New York Harbor, I engineered an end-to-end pipeline to predict future vessel coordinates with high geospatial precision.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
* **Advanced Modeling:** Benchmarked **LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiLSTM-Attention** architectures.
* **Key Finding:** **BiLSTM-Attention** achieved the highest accuracy for complex maneuvers, while **GRU** offered the best latency (8ms) for real-time systems.
* **ETL Optimization:** Automated the data preprocessing pipeline, reducing execution time by **85% (from 6 hours to 45 mins)** for 5M+ records using sliding window sequencing.
* **Custom Metrics:** Implemented **Haversine Distance Loss** to minimize physical error in kilometers rather than just statistical MSE.

### 📊 Performance Benchmarks
All models were trained on the same New York Harbor dataset with a look-back window of 10 timestamps.

| Model Architecture | MSE Loss | Haversine Error (km) | Inference Time (ms) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LSTM | 0.0042 | 0.15 | 12 |
| GRU | 0.0038 | 0.14 | **8** (Best Latency) |
| BiLSTM | 0.0035 | 0.12 | 18 |
| **BiLSTM-Attention** | **0.0029** | **0.09** (Best Accuracy) | 22 |

### 🧩 System Architecture

#### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
The raw AIS data (MMSI, Latitude, Longitude, SOG, COG) contained noise and irregular timestamps.
* **Cleaning:** Filtered out stationary vessels (SOG < 0.5 knots) and anomalous GPS jumps.
* **Normalization:** MinMax scaling applied to coordinates to ensure stable gradient descent.
* **Sequence Generation:** Created a sliding window dataset ($X_t$ = past 10 mins, $Y_t$ = next 1 min).

#### 2. The Model (BiLSTM-Attention)
The core innovation is the **Attention Layer**, which allows the model to "focus" on specific past time steps (e.g., the start of a turn) rather than treating all history equally.

```python
# Code Snippet: Custom Attention Mechanism
def attention_3d_block(inputs):
    a = Permute((2, 1))(inputs)
    a = Dense(inputs.shape[1], activation='softmax')(a)
    a_probs = Permute((2, 1))(a)
    output_attention_mul = Multiply()([inputs, a_probs])
    return output_attention_mul
